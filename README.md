# STATA
This repository contains the solution to a hands-on STATA exercise designed to assess proficiency in STATA data manipulation, analysis, and interpretation. The exercise is divided into tasks that cover various aspects of data handling, estimation, outlier correction, and food consumption analysis.

## Introduction
The STATA Exam Exercise Repository is created to showcase my ability to work with STATA for data analysis tasks. The repository is organized into tasks based on a provided dataset and specific instructions.

## Tasks
The exercise consists of the following tasks:

1. Estimation: In this task, I perform estimation and descriptive analysis on a household dataset. The analysis includes calculating household size averages, considering sampling weights, and estimating standard errors.

2. Outlier Correction: This task involves identifying and correcting outliers in a consumption dataset. I convert currency units, calculate item-specific statistics, and replace outliers with missing values.

3. Democratic Food Shares Wrong: Here, I calculate the share of food items in the consumption bundle per household using a "democratic" approach. However, a conceptual error leads to incorrect results.

4. Democratic Food Shares Correct: This task corrects the conceptual mistake from the previous task and recalculates food shares accurately.

## Usage 
To replicate the analysis or understand the implementation, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have STATA installed.
3. Open the First_NameLast_Name .do file  in STATA.
4. Adjust the file paths as needed.
5. Run the code in STATA to reproduce the analysis.
